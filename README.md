# Princess
Predicting tool for CBC GW observations

This tool aims to link astophysical models with gravatational wave observations for compact binary coalescences.
It's separated in different package, and will be upgrade in the next months.

For an easy start you can simply follow the file Getting_started.py. It will present step by step all the set up needed, and contains the parameters you would like to set for your study.
The available package are:

Princess.Starter: This package contains functions to load your astrophysical catalogue and make it usuable with Princess.stochastic and Princess.selection
Princess.Stochastic: Make prediction on the astrophysical gravatational wave background.
Princess.Selection: Evaluate the population wich would be observed with individual events. 

## Princess.starter

AstroModel.py : Define your model with the needed parameter

## Princess.stochastic

## Princess.selection
