# Princess
Predicting tool for CBC GW observations

This tool aims to link astophysical models with gravatational waves observation for compact binary coalescences.
Its separated in different package, and will be upgrade in the next months.
The available package are:

Princess.starter: This package contains function to load your astrophysical catalogue and make it usuable with P.stochastic and P.selection
Princess.stochastic: Make prediction on the astrophysical gravatational wave background.
Princess.selection: Evaluate the population wich would be observed with individual events. 

## Princess.starter

Getting_started.py : In this file are set up all the paraetrs wich would be needed for 

## Princess.stochastic

## Princess.selection
