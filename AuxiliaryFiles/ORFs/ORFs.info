ORF.dat (2018) :
Old overlap reduction function given by Tania. In this file we assume ET to be a triangle (E1, E2, and E3) located as the Virgo Detector,
and CE two detectors of 40 km located and oriented as american LIGOs.

ORF_3G_2ETal.dat (2022):
Overlap reduction function calculated with ORF_Calculation.py using the developpement from 'Sensitivity of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory to a stochastic background, and its dependence on the detector orientations
' (https://journals.aps.org/prd/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevD.48.2389) equations 4.1-3 and B.11-13.
Here we assumed \Delta always equal to 0 (which is the max), 2*\delta = 0 (aligned)
